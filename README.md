# Twitter-Clone
A clone of the famous Twitter app, built using Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB. This project is the result of me trying to learn Full Stack development and familiarizing myself with the conecpts.

Deployed to Heroku: https://twitter-clone-727.herokuapp.com/

Sorry if the commit messages seem a bit unprofessional. I planned to do this project just for myself to see so I was just letting off some steam with those more casual commit messages.
